# How to contribute
 
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.


Here are some important resources:

## Testing

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using tab, see https://qelectrotech.org/wiki_new/doc/qt_creator#on_ajoute_le_style_de_code_qet

Thanks,
